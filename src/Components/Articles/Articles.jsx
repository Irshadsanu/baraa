        KSA recently announced the establishment of new Special Integrated
        Logistics Zones (“ILBZ”) aimed at attracting foreign investment and
        increasing the perception of KSA as a regional hub. As per the
        regulations setting out the rules for ILBZ, entities established and
        carrying out approved activities inside ILBZ will be exempt from KSA
        corporate income tax for fifty years. In addition to the income tax
        exemption, the initiative will not consider non-residents conducting
        economic activities inside the Zone as Permanent Establishments. Also,

        Additionally, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Human Resources and Social

        freedom of movement between employers, signalling a substantial
        modification to the private sector sponsorship system, from March 2021. 
        Healthcare and education industries are in the process of progressing

        continuously improve and attract foreign tourism and investors willing
